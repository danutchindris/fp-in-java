## Functional Programming in Java

### Program Structure

Input data + Transformations + Output data = Algorithm

### Imperative vs. Declarative Programming

- imperative programming: we tell the computer what we want and *how* it should be done, step by step
  - there's a lot of room for errors
  - verbose
  - understanding the algorithm is more difficult because of its complexity
  - when reading the code we have to go back and forth (e.g. when reading a loop)

- declarative programming: we tell the computer what we want but *not* how to do it
  - the algorithm resembles the problem statement
  - more concise
  - less room for errors
  - we understand what the algorithm does by reading it in one pass

### Streams

- a List is like a bucket - it holds data
  - a List is a data structure
- a Stream is like a pipeline - it doesn't hold data, but it lets data flow through it
  - a Stream is *not* a data structure, it's an abstraction of the operations we apply to the data
